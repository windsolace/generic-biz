		<h2>General aircon servicing Vs. Chemical aircon wash Vs. Chemial cleaning?</h2>
		<p>While general aircon servicing is great for regular maintenance, you may need to opt for an aircon chemical clean or wash every once in a while. A chemical aircon service will thoroughly clean every part of your air conditioning unit to make sure the filters are clean, the refrigerant and water pipes are clear of any blockages and that the aircon unit is in perfect working condition. You may also like to understand more on the differences between an <a href="https://www.aircon-servicing.sg/aircon-chemical-wash/">aircon chemical wash</a> and <a href="https://www.aircon-servicing.sg/aircon-chemical-cleaning/">aircon chemical cleaning</a>.</p>
		<p>A general aircon servicing will use vacuums and non-chemical products to clean the aircon unit, whereas a chemical aircon service will flush out the system with chemical cleaning products. Both are important for maintaining your aircon unit, though a chemical aircon service may not be necessary as often. If you&#8217;re not sure what kind of service your aircon unit needs, it&#8217;s as easy as making a phone call to Aircon Servicing Singapore. We&#8217;ll discuss your aircon needs with you to bring you the best service possible.</p>
